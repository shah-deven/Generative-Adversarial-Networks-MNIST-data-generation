# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-MNIST-data-generation
GANs is a method for training generative models that was proposed in 2014 by Goodfellow et al. There are two neural networks in a GAN. One is called the generator which takes a random noise as input and outputs an image. The other is called the discriminator which is a binary classifier to classify whether an input image is a real image or a fake image generated by the generator. The goal of the generator is to generate images that can fool the discriminator into thinking the images are real.

## Dataset
GANs are notoriously finicky with hyperparameters, and also require many training epochs. In order to make this project approachable without a GPU, we will be working on the MNIST dataset, which is 60,000 training and 10,000 test images. Each picture contains a centered image of white digit on black background (0 through 9). This was one of the first datasets used to train convolutional neural networks and it is fairly easy -- a standard CNN model can easily exceed 99% accuracy.

To simplify our code here, we will use the PyTorch MNIST wrapper, which downloads and loads the MNIST dataset. See the documentation `https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/datasets/mnist.py` for more information about the interface. The default parameters will take 5,000 of the training examples and place them into a validation dataset. The data will be saved into a folder called MNIST_data.
